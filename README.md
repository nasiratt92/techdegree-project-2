# Basketball Stats Tool
On this occasion I tasked to create a basic statistics displaying project.

I was given the following interface:

As well as detailed breakdown of the arithmetics I needed to undertake to get to the stats.

## Wins

* Using list **comprehensions**
* Using range function part of a passing argument in the (line 71)
* Placed all of logic and function calls inside of a **dunder main** block at the bottom of the file
* Successfully **imported player data** from a local file

## Challenges

The main challenges whilst working on this project was creating the error handling function `get_int_from_user` took time to get it right and required a lot of TAs assistance (over slack).

The IDE I worked on this project was not the same as the IDE used by the TAs, resulting in scripting errors and other blindspots. In order to over come this, a second treehouse workspace based project was created and debugged using the console.

## Future
Given the opportunity and time to undertake this project again, I would attempt the Extra Credit criteria, such as:
* Displaying the average height value of the team
* Displaying the sum of experienced players/non-experianced players on the team
* Importing keyboard module to work with key press of the return key
